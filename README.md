# arduino-nixie-clock
Custom IN-12 Nixie clock with RTC and arduino

This code is messy and specific to my board design. I made one change after recieving the boards. I needed a 5volt power pin for the rotary encoder. I scrapped up a trace to a digital pin on the button header and added a bodge wire for 5 volts.
